## Figure 0

**Bold gets two asterisks before and after**:

1. Numbered lists look like this (Number, period, then single space, then the start of the text). The data quality for countries a, b, and c is rated as unreliable.
2. The **bold definition** of the indicator has this issue with the numerator, but the effect on the interpretation is that this accentuates the conclusion
5. This will be re-numbered

Every paragraph needs a blank line above and below it. Overall as can be seen from the figure the trend is up for high income women and low for the women in the poorest quintile. This has _implications for policy_ (note that italics have an underscoe before and after):

- (unordered lists have a dash at the beginning and one space after). This is one policy implication and
- this is another policy implication

And this the end of the caption.
